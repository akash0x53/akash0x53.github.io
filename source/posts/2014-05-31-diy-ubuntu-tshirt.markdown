Okay, so lets start.  
 
1.You can Buy some solid colored T-Shirt if you don't have one. I'd ordered from [Jabong](http://www.jabong.com). Cost around 300-500 INR.  
2.Buy your favorite Fabric Color from local store. I've used White Faber Castle. Cost around ~20 INR.  
3.Print Ubuntu logo on A4 page. (Please convert [this](http://design.ubuntu.com/wp-content/uploads/logo-ubuntu_st_no%C2%AE-white-hex.svg) svg file into jpeg and replace orange color with white and white with black).  
4.Now you're all set to go!  
5.Okay so first boring, hectic job to do! Create stencil by removing black parts from image. [More on stencils](http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Spray-Paint-Stencils)  
6.Before start spraying, iron tee with dry iron so to removes wrinkles and stretch tee.  
7.Put some paper or water resistance paper inside T-shirt so that color won't transfer from front to backside.  
8.Use a good flat surface for work and place the created stencil on T-shirt.
