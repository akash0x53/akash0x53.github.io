Hello friends, this post is about LaTeX report. Recently i submitted my final year project report to college. Instead of using M$ word i tried LaTeX.<!--more--> Believe me guys LaTeX (latex) is fun! Though it took me almost 20 days to finalize the documentation, but it was fun, quality was good and it looks professional.  

I'm aslo latex beginner, but i managed to do lots of things in LaTeX like drawing UML diagrams, block diagrams, customizing page and much more. I have made my project template available for you guys as reference, you can fork, download it from [here](https://github.com/akash0x53/report_latex).  

Download and install latest Latex version, install packages mentioned in README section.
