This is my first application that i coded in Python and designed GUI using Glade+Gtk.</br>
Millions of people use way2sms site for sending free SMS across india. There is no official desktop application provided by way2sms. So i create this app that gives you good GUI,faster speed,same contact list as you have on your way2sms account.
